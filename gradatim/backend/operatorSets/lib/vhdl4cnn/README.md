# About this folder

This are files created for DOSA, but based on the [original Haddoc2 framework](https://github.com/DreamIP/haddoc2) (licensed under Apache 2.0).
This was necessary to avoid the legacy and huge dependencies of Haddoc2, which were not needed for the codeGen part.

During the course of the project, we created a fork of the haddoc2 framework called `VHDL4CNN` to be able to publish our re-factoring
of the VHDL library. The fork, including all license information, can be also found under **`backend/third_party_libs/`**.
