# About this folder

This are files created for DOSA, but based on the [original hls4ml framework](https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/hls4ml) (licensed under Apache 2.0).
This was necessary to better separate the TVM-to-hls4ml wrapper/converters.

The original repository, including all license information, can be also found under **`backend/third_party_libs/`**.
